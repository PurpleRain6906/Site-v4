        <p>
            I'm Sean, I'm 16 and have a passion for computers and electronics,
            <br />
            I'm a largely self-taught developer who hates the way the current education system works.
            <br />
            I work for <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>, while also being an active community member and moderator.
            <br />
            I especially enjoy using my current stack of Next.js/Astro, TailwindCSS and Vercel. However, I have used and enjoyed Ruby on Rails in the past.
